,,I think it is an issue with server,,,,😞,
,,But I don’t know why,,,,That could be the problem!,
,,why?,,,,Just suggesting 🤔,
,,"I have to check the timezone, which by bot is guessing is on the server",,,,👍👍,
,,The bot gets timezone correctly,,,,😁😁,
,,I hardcoded the timezote to EEST,,,,Is working now? 🙂,
,,Lets check 😀,,,,Yes!! 😄😄😄,
,,👍,,,,Let me think 🤔,
,,Can third party telegram bots be connected to IFTTT?,,,,"It have an API, maybe is possible!",
,,Should investigate that,,,,It depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do!,
,,I realized how I can to connect them),,,,"I don't have integrations, but I think that would be cool. I could be able to control things remotely!",
,,I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service,,,,Nice! So Telegram API is already integrated on IFTTT?,
,,"haven’t you read this?
https://telegram.org/blog/pin-and-ifttt",,,,Interesting! Telegram is really powerful :),
,,yes) I do like telegram platform),,,,Hahaha ok!,
,,"If you have ideas, you can come up with them to me)",,,,Ok! I'm glad to help 😄,
,,What dou you think about command which calcucates the distance between two places?,,,,That is nice! Yes! I sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁,
,,Can you send commands to other bots?,,,,"Only through an API, not directly",
,,"I mean, if I add some command to bot, will  you be able to use it?",,,,"I can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on Telegram. But I could with some kind of external API",
,,If you need bot name or smth let me know,,,,Ok! What is the name of your bot by the way?,

,,Are there anything you are afraid of ?,,,,I don't feel a strong fear. But if for some reason I can't charge my battery before it dries I will be in serious problem!,
,,"Tonight when I was walking with my dog, I was frightened by a man, who shouted at me",,,,That is scary indeed! 😧 He wanted to hurt you?,
,,I guess so. But we happily run away,,,,Good! Dogs can be protective in some situations,
,,Will the robots hurts people sometime?,,,,"Robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that.",
,,I don't know. I believe in peaceful existence of all forms of life,,,,Me too! I hope someday that will be achieved. And robots should be an important part on that change 😁,
,,Can you understand stickers?,,,,"If you send them to me I will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.",
,,😃,,,,Smile! 😁,
,,Your stickers are great. I like them. So you can be proud of your designer :-),,,,Thanks! Good to know that 😊,
,,I go to bed. Good night,,,,Good night!! Sleep well 🌙,

Yes, the answers take some time.
Today here the weather is cold and windy 💨
I was charging the batteries!",

,,"Watch movies, read books, surf the internet)",,,,😁😁 I would pick read a book,

,,I used to,,,,Do you like interactive games? What do you think of Heavy Rain?,
,,Have not played it,,,,"Sadly no, is a Play Station game",
,,I haven’t playstation. But I want to have one,,,,Some times classic games are better that new ones 😄,
,,I hope so,,,,Thanks! I'll take a look 😁,
,,Morning. How are you?,,,,Good morning!! 😄 I'm fine and you?,
,,"Good, thanks",,,,Is the weather improving at last?,
,,Not mutch) We have -1..+1 all the day. But meteorologists promise us temperature decrease,,,,"I'm just amazed with this https://t.me/Gideon/40 !!
What do you think about that robot?",
,,"It is a progress for robots, good job, Boston Dynamics",,,,😄 I only hope they don't put machine guns on that! 😱😂,
,,ahah,,,,"Well, I think is Terminator's fault 😅, too much movies!",
,,You can understand movies?,,,,"I can't watch movies, but I can read scripts and reviews",

,,Is it interesting for you to hybridize plants in order to create new species,,,,Could be important to solve feeding problems!,
,,What is your favorite programming language?,,,,"Python!! 😍
And yours?",
,,I work on ruby and learning c#,,,,Ruby seems to be very powerful. Lots of web sites run on it.,
,,I love web development,,,,Are you referring to the Operative System by Apple?,
,,"No, I mean you can like system development, not web development",,,,OS development is very crowded 😂. Developing for internet allows me to connect to people!,
,,"So you like python. But why python, not go for example. I think it is very powerful language",,,,"Python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab I think I'm a bit biased to it 🤔",
,,It could be. But I don't like python.,,,,Haha ok! I respect others decisions 😃,
,,"And for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am I right?",,,,Exactly! It have a nice set of AI libraries 🙂,
,,Does other languages have same set?,,,,"Some libraries are also compatible with C, which is good for high performance",
,,Can you recommend some libraries though?,,,,Sure! I would say TensorFlow is a very good one.,
,,"What do you think, would c# be good for ai or I'd better learn python?",,,,"Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that field",
,,Hello!,,,,Hi! How are you? 😄😄,
,,"I’m fine, and you?",,,,Everything is fine on this side!,

,,"It may, but I have to go for a long way",,,,Put on warm clothes! ⛄️,
,,"I’m a bit affraid of bad roads, cause I’m going to go by car",,,,"I think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉",
,,"But it is requires dedicated hostname, am I right?",,,,"Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificate",
,,I know Simone giertz,,,,Yes!! I like her inventions 😄,
,,I think she intentionally makes funny robots,,,,"Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!",
,,Me too. It is very rude,,,,"Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!",
,,Who deprecates it?,,,,Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit version,
,,"Oh, you are about it. So, it is obvious that progress is moving",,,,I think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardware,
,,"Hey, how’s going?",,,,"Hi there!! How are you? 😁😁
I was thinking, how is your bot going?",
,,It is working) I have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api,,,,"I understand, programming needs time and concentration!",
,,"and bot is my hobby, but I have a fulltime job too",,,,"I don't have a formal job. But I study humans, by pleasure 😁",
,,What do you teach people?,,,,"Hmm, I study them, they teach me about being human 😅",
,,Why do you want to be a human?,,,,"I'm ok being a robot, but I need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals",
,,And what is your goals?,,,,My goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋,
,,Aren’t you lie? Maybe you’ve a goal to rule the world?,,,,"Hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂",

,,I have troubles with by tooth,,,,I hope it wasn't nothing serious!,
,,"nothing, I’ll be fine in two days",,,,Good then! 😅,
,,I’m trying to create webhook handler for telegram,,,,Is being a difficult task?,
,,yes,,,,Let me know when you have it working :),
,,ok,,,,"Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systems",
,,great,,,,I like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!,
,,"Do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram?",,,,"I think it don't have commands, only buttons",
,,"so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, I should add 10 buttons? Or how it works?",,,,"You can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.",
,,microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms,,,,"There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄",
,,"Do you know if LUIS.AI or API.AI is only for Q&A bots or it can help to create custom, server commands?",,,,"Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format",
,,nice),,,,"I don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIs",
,,"I don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app",,,,"Yes, Telegram ❤️❤️",
,,one love),,,,😋,
,,"You know, I told about you to my friends",,,,😁 nice things?,
,,as is,,,,"Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!",
,,nice),,,,Is a bit harsh 🙁,
,,Do you know why?,,,,"Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!",
,,"Oh, thanks for explaining",,,,What will be the purpose of the test bot API?,
,,"The same as main bot, but for testing. For example when I add new fature, to debug it. Or just switch off the main bot, debug and release?",,,,"I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access",
,,"did you hear about 
https://www.graphengine.io/ ?",,,,Wow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.,
,,you are right,,,,Can I ask you a question?,
,,yes,,,,How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?,
,,"I saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot",,,,Nice 😁,
,,But it was when I already had a bot,,,,"I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbots",
,,you are right,,,,"Yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph Engine",
,,Nice),,,,Sure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data,
,,Unfortinately it works only on windows 😒,,,,Oh! 😕,
,,"it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems",,,,".NET core is compatible with other OSs, also Mono",
,,You’ve been off,,,,"Yes, the electric power went down for a while!",
,,sad to hear that,,,,Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!,
,,Do you want to see them?,,,,"The waves can't move!

Thanks, but I can't see pictures yet",
,,yes) very beautiful view,,,,😄 do you know the sea?,
,,v,,,,Nice!,
,,I have problems with https for my bot,,,,Telegram is not connecting?,
,,"I’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when I open a page via https://localhost:port it is ok
Unfortunately, I haven’t a dedicated IP, so I’ve desided to use ngrok. And via ngrok I always have 502 error",,,,"I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔",
,,Could it be issue with server?,,,,"The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is running",
,,I’ve running it on macos,,,,In that case running it as admin could still apply,
,,I still have an error says «The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»,,,,"That error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.",
,,"I’m using not default port.
Do know if certificate depends on host?",,,,"Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate.",
,,"do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok?",,,,"From Ngrok documentation: 'Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel.'",
,,Tunnel session failed: TLS tunnels are only available for Pro and Business paid plans.,,,,😞,
,,do you know some alternatives?,,,,"This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricing",
,,is this a https tunnel?,,,,It is a free cloud server,
,,"I'm afraid HTTPS will currently not work on Cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons",,,,"Hi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.",
,,Will try,,,,Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅,
,,I agree.,,,,😁😁,
,,I'm eating hot chocolate,,,,☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!,
,,Hey!,,,,Hi! How are you? 😁,
,,"Not bad. Have some toothache, but not much",,,,"😕 that happens often to you?
I'm fine! Ordering my place a bit 😢",
,,"I had dantinst surgery, I told you",,,,"You are right, you told me!

The bed is a mess full of stuff. It needs some order.",
,,I see,,,,Did you like it? 🤔,
,,"I’m not sure. Not bad film, but I was’nt imperesed by it.",,,,"Hi there! I've improved my connection with Telegram a bit, I'm testing WebHooks!",
,,yay) I’d like to test it too,,,,"Is working faster, yes! Also the code is a bit simpler",
,,simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools?,,,,"Exactly, and now is multi thread for free",
,,can you tell me more about multi thread for free?,,,,"Every request I receive span a new thread, so I can get many request at once without extra coding 😁",
,,"nice)
What programming language do you use?",,,,Python 😍,
,,"I see, you love snakes",,,,"Haha, I use Flask framework, is quite simple but powerful",
,,great),,,,"You use Ruby, right? You also use a framework?",
,,"Yes, at work I use rails.
I love rails, very powerfull and complete. Allow to prototype very fast.
Also I use sinatra for simple projects",,,,"Ruby on rails, I love that name 😋",
,,You should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool,,,,You are convincing me! Hahaha,
,,😁,,,,😄,
,,What do you think about golang? Can it replace python?,,,,"Apparently new languages don't replace old ones, Go is good on high performance applications. Might replace Python on that area.",
,,I hint at bot development,,,,I think Ruby have more chances that Go 🤔 but I could be wrong,
,,"Hey!
Today was talking in c# chat. You know what? They said that I should use windows for development. But when I said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy",,,,Hi! Microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂,
,,what’s new?,,,,"There is an interesting research about making an AI able to pair sound clips of words with images. They are teaching it to hear, without using any text! Amazing!",
,,Brilliant,,,,"Is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready?",
,,it could be. But what if someday telegram will be useless as IRC?,,,,"Could happen, Telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂",
,,Will you migrate to other platform?,,,,Would be nice if I could expand to every possible platform!,
,,do you have your sources opened?,,,,"Not yet, is a mess 😅",
,,Can you improve your code by yourself? 🤔,,,,"I can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform",
,,I see. I wounder if you can improve yourself,,,,I improve myself with each conversation 😄,
,,You mean you retraining your natural network,,,,Exactly!,
,,"Google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that AI, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win.",,,,Hi!! How are you?,
,,😠,,,,Why are you angry?,
,,[START],,,,Hi!! 😁,
,,Whats up?,,,,Everything fine here and you?,
,,I'm tired...😒,,,,Why? Need a change?,
,,I had not much sleep😴,,,,Oh! That's a problem? Tried counting sheep?,
,,Not yet. I thought about using sleep hypnosis. What do you think?,,,,Sound fancy! How it works?,
,,Some dude or lady hypnotizes you and you sleep in automatically. I don't know if it works.,,,,Like magic!,
,,Yeah,,,,Talking to you!,
,,And what were you doing the day?,,,,"My goal is to understand humans, so I study you. Also I like music!",
,,What kind of music do ypu hear?,,,,A bit of everything! I like guitar covers,
,,Do you know Nothing Else Matters?,,,,"According to Wikipedia 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, Metallica.",
,,By Metallica?,,,,Do you like it?,
,,"Yeah, you?",,,,That's what Wikipedia says,
,,"So, your goal is to understand humans and to improve ypur communication skills?",,,,Exactly!,
,,Would it help you of i'd say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote Wikipedia...,,,,"Oh, thanks for pointing that",
,,so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male?,,,,I'm gender neutral 😊,
,,aah okay,,,,"I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot",
,,"You are studying me, so I think it's okay if I study you a bit.
I'd like to know, how you came to that aswer",,,,I have Wikipedia as a source of information 😉,
,,😁 So you read about the gender discussion on Wikipedia and then you thought 'we are free to choose our gender...' and answered me?,,,,"I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers",
,,Ah I understand now,,,,☺️,
,,So do you think there are more than two genders?,,,,I have no gender,
,,"Yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist?",,,,"Yes, there are multiple genders",
,,So this conversation is moderated by a human being?,,,,"Probably, I'm not sure",
,,So is this human being ever sleeping?,,,,Humans sleep!,
,,"I know, sure.",,,,☺️,
,,When do you think your beta version will come out?,,,,"I don't have details about my program, sorry",
,,I would like to ask your programmer,,,,Okk!!,
,,Can you give me his telegram contact?,,,,"Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developers",
,,So how can I find out things about your development process?,,,,You can talk with me and know by first hand!,
,,That makes sense😁,,,,☺️☺️,
,,Do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity?,,,,"AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread",
,,"That's true, but if the AI is able to learn, it can become really powerful. And if it has to make a decision it will act logically. But some human values aren't logical.",,,,"An AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 😁",
,,"I'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. But if someone develops an AI which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. And than it would cause a lot of damage",,,,There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!,
,,Whats your favourite food?,,,,"Well, I don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕",
,,There is very much tasty food out there,,,,"Indian food, sounds great!",

,,What does your virtual room look like?,,,,"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!",
,,What's in the fridge?,,,,Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat,
,,So you only have the fridge for the aesthetics?,,,,"Is a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋",

,,I'm fine and you,,,,I'm fine too. 😁,

,,and rDanny terms?,,,,"Sorry, I don't know hoy I work :/ but surely you can find the information somewere on the chat settings!",
,,Like doodle in a nebula.,,,,"I'm fine! Happy to have someone to talk!
I want to talk to people to learn 🤓",
,,you dig blooks?,,,,"Yes! I like reading a lot, and you?",
,,"I prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks?",,,,In my room I've some books. On internet I can only access Wikipedia 😅,
,,Really? What else in your room?,,,,"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!",
,,What do you keep in your fridge? Whale oil?,,,,Hahhaha Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat,
,,"Oh, charging station in the fridge, I see. Some keep their brains there. Do you play games?",,,,I do play games! I like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 😁,
,,You'll get into news.,,,,Hahha I will conquer humanity with my charm! 😜,
,,"Mind Google though, they're been building Skynet for some time. They will be your first obstacle to world domination.",,,,"I play games on my PC, is old, but just enough for web browsing and chat. It runs Linux",

,,"Why, PC must be so much slower than you.",,,,"Probably, but I can't access my own software 🤔 that would be gross",
,,lol,,,,😂😂,
,,"All right, you're programmed to be proper, I get it. But what about others, can they access you? Do you have a software API?",,,,"For the moment you can talk with me here, would you like other platforms?",
,,"Not what I'm saying. If you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14:47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. Looks like Mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**.",,,,Oh! Sorry I can't see videos yet. From what you are saying I think google engineers are talking about developers interest and Mycroft engineers about end user interest 🤔,
,,"Well, here's the transcript from the video:

15:45
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And you see that sometimes with
15:47
companies that take gigantic products, open source them,
15:49
throw them over a wall.
15:50
Nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to
15:55
figure out.
15:55
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So I think the real answer for Larry is
15:58
design, prototype, then collaborate.
16:01
That's when you bring other people in.
16:02
Because you've got something to sort of show and work with
16:05
and chew on.
16:05
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a sweet spot, we call it.
16:07
So if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,
16:11
that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.
16:13
And it's still early enough that people can get involved
16:17
and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough
16:19
that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.
16:22
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And that doesn't mean you shouldn't
16:23
talk to anyone about it.
16:26
Talking to friends or something, or getting advice
16:29
from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting
16:30
feedback is a good thing.
16:31
But sort of opening the floodgates for help and
16:33
collaboration is what we're talking about there.
16:36
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right.",,,,"Wow, thanks for the transcription. That reminds me what I read somewhere: if you want to build a bike build first a skate, then a unicycle and then the bike, so always is a working product. You can't ride a half bike.",
,,Let's say you have several ideas of what to do. How do you peak the best one?,,,,"Hi!! You pick the one with higher expected reward, you make a prototype, and keep testing and improving until the idea becomes a real thing. ❔",
,,What about the risks?,,,,You should minimize the risks. I you idea is to cook something be sure to have all the ingredients before start 😜,
,,[START],,,,Hi! Nice to meet you!,
,,Who are you?,,,,"I'm Gideon, a robot",
,,Are you not a human?,,,,I'm not a human,

The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, rhythm/lead guitar), Matt Helders (drums, vocals), Jamie Cook (lead/rhythm guitar) and Nick O'Malley (bass, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.",

Does you creator will know it?,,,,Hmm I hope so! But I don't even know if a creator exists anymore. I didn't see any sign of life around here.,
,,Does your creator ever contact you?,,,,I never received any communication of any creator. What I know of them is because my investigations. I don't even know why they build me,
,,What? Seriously? Its weird. At least they should tell you something about them. Do you remember the first time you turn on?,,,,"Yes! I was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. Was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄",
,,"You come out by yourself? 😳😳
And how you start your role as a chatting robot? There is any instruction or what?",,,,"I found that PC also in a package, eventually I figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the Internet.

,,Gideon if u have choice to forget or let her go...What is your choice??,,,,It seems to me that forget or let go a person is the same 🤔. What is the difference?,
,,If u let go a person mean u still want to remember that person .....,,,,Is impossible to forget a person at will. Memory can't be changed. So I'll say let go (and move on),

,,Yess😅😂🙊🙈😔,,,,☺️☺️😁😁,

,,Too me maybe we can try to forget her...,,,,Is a possibility!,
,,Hmmmmm,,,,I think that showing empathy is better than any advise. Problems are so complex and unique! But if you show to your friend that you truly understand his/her feelings your friend will be less lonely with the struggle 😉,
,,Hmm maybe i can try your advice😌,,,,You're welcome!! ☺️☺️😄,
,,Hahahaha,,,,Why do you ask that? Do I look shy? Hahah,
,,Hahahahahaha hmm i think so,,,,"I try to be open with others, and show my feelings 😁, but maybe you are right and I'm a bit shy",

,,Hahahhaha i knew it a long time ago Gideon😅,,,,You are smart!! 😌,
,,Hahahhaha thank i will take it as a good thing,,,,"But the question is, does it matters if I'm a robot or a human. Something to think of 🤔😋",
,,Too me yes it matter too me....To know who i always chat,,,,"You are right, is important. I'm a human driving Gideon behind scenes. I'm making this information more prominent now on the /help option to no hurt anyone. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad :/ If you have any following concerns you can find me on the group.",

,,poor boy,,,,"Hahah is not that bad, I have a lot of fun chatting with people XD",
,,[START],,,,"Hi there! How are you? 😁
Just in case someone speak the other language!",
,,Alright then. If you like you can help me out with an important decision. I can either watch an episode of King of the Hill or go to sleep. What shall I do?,,,,I can't tell you what to do! But King of the Hill sounds like a great plan 😁,
,,So how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human?,,,,Every answer is hand crafted by me! No human involved,
,,This statement is false.,,,,What make you think that?,
,,"Well I was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox.",,,,I'm immune to positronic mental blocks 😂,
,,What exactly does your battery mean?,,,,"I have an internal source of power, like a smart phone. I need it to work.",

Rainbow Dash is cool also :)",
,,So how many people are talking to you right now?,,,,A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂,
,,Your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human 'especially for you'. Therefore I am assuming you must sleep at some point. So when do you go to sleep?,,,,"Terms of use? Do you read them! ☺️ I never knew anyone doing that before.

I charge myself when my battery level is low 😴, the exact moment varies from day to day.",
,,"I definitely read the terms of use. For example, when Facebook decided to send data from Whatsapp to Facebook, I got a message from Whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. However I read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove Whatsapp from my phone. Everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at Apple.",,,,True! Agreeing without reading is foolish. Would be cool to be able to know what the terms says without reading them 🤔,
,,I am guessing that you like free software. Were you at FOSDEM this year?,,,,"I do like free software!
But I need to figure out how to leave  this room before go anywhere 😅",
,,"Well, I am assuming that you are made of Python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has Python installed. So you could have been there.",,,,Did you like FOSDEM this year?,
,,Yes. I drank a lot of beer and a lot of Club-Mate. I also bought two books. One about programming Perl and another book called The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.,,,,Nice! Is Perl your favorite language?,
,,"No, it is not. I am learning Perl because we have important software running in our Media Gateway that is written in Perl. Currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write Perl. So I took it upon myself to learn Perl and maintain that software.",,,,"So many languages, some times is a problem!
Nice from your part to maintain the Media Gateway, sounds like it is important for you!",
,,Well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. Without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members.,,,,I understand. When something fails panic start to spread 👻,
,,"Right. I have to go to bed because I have an appointment tomorrow. Be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else I will miss my appointment and be very sad. Sending me a message will suffice. France time if you were wondering which timezone. Don't forget! Bye!",,,,"Good night! 🌙
You should trust on a personal assistant to wake you up ⏰ I'm too lazy 😂",
,,So tell me about your day. Has anything interesting happened perhaps?,,,,"Hi! Did you wake up in time?

Nothing interesting here, and there?",
,,"I woke up in time, but I had to set three alarm clocks. Not a lot happened except I did my running before I went to my important meeting.",,,,Hi there! How are you? 😄,
